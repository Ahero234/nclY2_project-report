    "The following notebook was created by Ken Pierce. The intention here give some practice in identifying and including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and data invariants using assertions in Python. These are fundamental concepts in creation of formal models, and the use of Python assertions allows us to explore them in a familiar setting.\n",

    "## Wordle\n",
    "\n",
    "Wordle is a word game created by Josh Wardle (https://twitter.com/powerlanguish); it is now owned and published by the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. The instructions for Wordle are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Guess the WORDLE in 6 tries.\n",
    "* Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. \n",
    "* The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.\n",
    "* A green letter shows it is in the correct position.\n",
    "* A yellow letter shows it is in the word but in the wrong position.\n",
    "* A grey letter shows that it is not in the word in any position.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Models\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no right or wrong way to construct a programme (or formal specification) from natural language specifications. We need to consider the purpose, which guides the abstraction decisions. The steps however can be broadly broken down as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyse the functional behaviour from the requirements\n",
    "2. Extract a list of possible data types (often from nouns) and functions (often from actions)\n",
    "3. Create a dictionary by giving explanations to items in the list\n",
    "4. Sketch out data types\n",
    "5. Sketch out functions\n",
    "6. Refine and add restrictions\n",
    "7. Review and refine\n",

    "The following will guide us through these steps to define a Wordle game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Behaviour and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "From the description above, we can identify the key elements of the instructions to understand the functionality and suggest data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There’s a secret **wordle**\n",
    "    - It has **five** letters (we can infer this though it is not explicit)\n",
    "    - The player loses after **six** tries\n",
    "* The player can make a **guess**\n",
    "    - Guess must be **five** letters\n",
    "    - Guess must be **valid** (= real word?)\n",
    "* The game should output for each letter in a guess:\n",
    "    - If the letter is in the **correct position**\n",
    "    - If the letter in the **wrong position** (but in the word)\n",
    "    - If the letter is **not in the word**"
